This project is related to mine because the whole project, from function and materials to fabrication, the goal is very similar. The only difference is that instead of a micro:bit, he has used another form of technology to create sound.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

Before the reading, I always believed that interactive objects were created for people to learn how to use them. I understood that some things were designed badly, for example: doors, and that this encouraged others to build them better, but I believed people just learnt to use whatever was placed in front of them.

I learnt about signifiers and affordances and began to notice these things throughout my day in everyday objects, judging them all. If a door was not labelled, I would immediately be annoyed at it and begin to think on how I would change it. When using an application, I would notice the mappping of the pages and make a judgement based on how easy and efficient the navigation was. The most important for me was the feedback. I've always known that an elevator button turns coloured when pressed and a crossing button doesn't, but this realisation made me wonder the process behind crossing buttons; do they count the amount of pushes or only trigger an action like an elevator? Overall, this reading opened my mind to the design of everything.

I would like to know how this information has influenced everyday objects so far. There have been many references to doors, sinks and buttons being designed terribly but what has been changed and implemented into the world today? Have any of these designs significantly grown in popularity? Are some of them now used globally? These are all questions that I would like to laern more about.

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*
This reading does somewhat relate to my project but can definitely be used to improve it. The micro:bit guitar already affords lifting, playing and entertainment and these signifiers are also present. Feedback is incorporated through the micro:bit LEDs which show light and axis levels. Some ways this reading could improve the overall quality of this project could be

## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

The development phase of this project began with the coding. I copied the code provided by micro:bit's guitar tutorial and only changed the tones of the buttons.

I then used online sources to find the notes for the desired songs I wanted to replicate for the buttons.

After this, the code was finished and the physical object had to be built.

This process began and an immediate issue arrised. The guitar tutorial required alligator clips and I did not own any so I drove to Bunnings and bought alligator clips and some wire which were put together by using pliers.

Then a sketch was made of an electrical guitar and redrawn onto cardboard. Two of these were cut out.

A hole was cut into the back piece in order to create an access panel to the electricals that would be placed inside.

Another smaller shape was added to the front piece for style and a hole was cut out as a place to display the micro:bit.

On the inside of the front piece, the removal of some cardboard was necessary in order fit the micro:bit, alligator clips and battery pack port.

A circular shape was cut from the front piece in order for the speaker to fit inside. A thin strip of cardboard was left down the middle to hold the speaker while the alligator clips attached from the inside.

Side pieces were made in order to make the guitar more dimensional. These pieces were secured with tape and glue in order to ensure that it held the complex shape.

A neck was then cut from the cardboard. The top side had a flat, straight piece while the bottom was much wider. This was so the neck would also be more three dimensional, curving around to make a semi-circular shape.

![Image](19.jpg)

After this had been attached, a design was put on the guitar to reflect the sound. I felt this particular pattern was trendy, chaotic and nailed the crazy sound of the guitar. It was not placed arounf the entire guitar because I worried it would look to busy and the carboard added a really nice colour.

After this, the shell was complete! The micro:bit battery pacj and alligator clips were secured with tape and then it was ready to play.

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Micro:bit Guitar ###

### Project description ###

This project is an electronic guitar that has been coded to produce different frequencies, depending on the light level and axis/positioning of the guitar. This is due to the use of the accelerometer and light sensor on the micro:bit, reacting by producing different frequencies. This project does not have a targeted audience or age range as it is easy to play and very lightweight. Because it is an instrument, the typical use is purely for entertainment.

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
