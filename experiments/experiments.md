*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### SAY "HELLO" TO THE BBC micro:bit! ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

After pressing the SW1 button, a smiley face is displayed.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learned was how to create a basic circuit on a breadboard.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as displaying information outside of a business: opening hours, products, event times, etc.

### USING A LIGHT SENSOR & ANALOG INPUTS ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

The room had little light and therefore the micro:bit displayed a moon shape.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learned was that a phototransistor is able to measure light and then can be coded to have different functions at different light levels.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as light that are triggered by the absence of light or windows that appear darker in bright settings and clear in dark ones.

### DIMMING AN LED USING A POTENTIOMETER ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

The potentiometer is turned 3/4 of the way, presenting a reasonably bright light.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was the complexity of the wiring and understanding how the circuit worked.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
